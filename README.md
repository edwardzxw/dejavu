Tools I wrote to make daily work happier:)

## dejavu
I see this name has been widely used:) search projects with it on github returns multiple results. Anyway I'd insist to use it because I'm a fan of the Friends TV serials, there's one episode (I don't remember which one) Phoebe saying that "I'm having a Deja Vu" and I remembered this word.

This tool were wrote while I was in Qilinsoft, at that time I need a tool to create a directory using date as name to store temp files which can be referenced in future.

The initial version has a desktop bottom right icon, by double click it will create the directory aforementioned.

Right click it would pop-up preference menu which allows you to set the root directory contains created directories.

It's pretty simple, but do save my time creating those directories manually.

I have some new ideas to make it serve me better, currently the one I'm working on is logged as [issue #1](../../issues/1).
